The data analysis is about the titanic data set which was obtained from
(https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).As we observethe data we can 
see their is information about demographics and passenger information from 
891 of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic.

The main area we are concentrating is to obtain:
1) which class of people has the highest survival rate? 
2) was a age one of the factor for survival rate not considering thegender 
and class? 
3) which gender has the higher survival rate wheather it is male or female? 
4) most of the survived people are of which group of age? 
5) Did embarkation point affect the survival rate?

In order to achive this we undergo different phases:

1) Cleaning of data
2) Handling missing values 
3) Data Exploration

More Info:-

Missing observations: I could use the fare coloum for my analsis to know whether 
their were any categories based on that
Missing features : The given dataset consists of information related to passengers
only. They should have provided the information related to the staff also. In order 
to maintain such a huge ship they must be atleast 100 people.
Missing values : As from the above analysis i can say that their were 177 values 
missing in the age colomn and 2 values missing in the embarkation point.
