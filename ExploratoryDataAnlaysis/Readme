Exploratory data analysis. 


The Exploratory data analysis was done on Oklahoma Presidential Campaign.
In this exploration the main area of concentrating is all about

Which candidate got the most support?
Which party got the most support ?
Was gender a factor in presidential election?

In order to achive this i went through data wrangling phases in order 
to make the data consistent and clean.

The cleaning process included cleaning in different steps:
1) Removing unncessary data.
2) Cleaning City name.
3) cleaning State name.
4) Udjusting zip code values.
5)Cleaning Employer information.
6)Amount colomn
7)Make the date values in consistent format.

Later in the Project I made different kinds of plots in order to explore the
data clearly
1) Univariant plots
2) Bivariant plots
3) Multi Variant plots

And at the end of each plot i have made clear analysis about each plot.

And finally the conclusion from all the plots.
