Open street map 
The agenda in this project is to filter data, correct the data which has some errors.

In this project we select an area and we clean the area names that are having 
problems. The main objective is to clean the open street map(OSM) data and 
perform analysis.

So as to perform the analysis we convert the OSM file to CSV format.
And then we perform the analysis.
